    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <p>
	Hi, my name is Lan Ziming (蓝子明). I’m a fresh graduate from Republic Polytechnic in 2008 with a diploma 
	in Information Technology and finished my National Service (conscript army) in September 2010. I am currently looking
	for a job in the <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> sector. If you are interested to know more about me,
	feel free to read on and hopefully it will help you to make an informed decision as to whether I am the right 
	choice for your company.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>
	During my time in Republic Polytechnic, I’m trained in the basics of web development with <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> as
	as some java programming as part of our curriculum. For my 2 final year projects, my teams are responsible for
    building a logic gates simulator for students’ learning in Java as well as a car rental website built with the 
	<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web framework. Thus learning some python as well. 
	While I have forgotten almost all of what I learnt previously in polytechnic due to my neglect of revising during my national 
	service, I have since regretted this mistake and am starting to re learn what I have forgotten again from scratch. This personal 
	website is my first step towards it.
	</p>
	
	<h3>What I could do</h3>
    <ul>
	  <li>
	  Very basic web development in <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> or with the
	  <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web framework in Python.
	  </li>
	  <li>Implement very basic web layouts.</li>
	  <li>Basic Java SE programming.</li>
	  <li>Some LaTeX report works.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>What I couldn’t do</h3>
      <p>
	  Despite wanting to be good at it, I have to admit that I have 0 talent in designing (visual sense). 
	  Thus if you require someone who could design great looking websites, create awesome flash animations,
      take breathtaking photographs or to do some graphic design in photoshop, I’m afraid I am not your best choice 
	  unfortunately. But if you want to teach me, I will be glad to listen.
	  </p>
